# HW04A/B
## HW04A - Motion 3d Loop()&Random()-based Shape

Explore 3D model to create "C" letter shape along with the rotation of letters.

I encountered difficulties for using draw() to create the 3D rotate motions while the color will refresh at the same frame rate. I end up with using array to store the randomly generate list in the setup() stage to dissolve te problem.
